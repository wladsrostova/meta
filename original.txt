## Putin extends his one-man rule for another term (Путин продлил своё авторитарное правление ещё на один срок)

Authorities claimed turnout was 77 percent, but that dubious figure was inflated by polling station raffle prizes and employer requirements that workers vote.  Russians are not enthusiastic about a regime that has sent hundreds of thousands of men to the **meat grinder** that is the Ukraine war and that “persecutes people for laying flowers on Navalny’s grave.”

“Perhaps Putin’s rule is safe” for now, said Samantha de Bendern in The Guardian. He controls the media, **feeding Russians a diet** of propaganda extolling him, and he would likely have won even a fair election. Still, ahead of the election, hundreds of thousands of voters signed petitions to support banned opposition candidates, while on voting day untold numbers wrote in Navalny or otherwise spoiled their ballots.

## The furor over Trump’s ‘**bloodbath**’ warning (Фурор вокруг заявления Трампа о "_кровавой бане_")

Donald Trump and his allies pushed back this week against an uproar over his claim that, if he’s not re-elected, there’s “going to be a bloodbath for the country.” At a campaign appearance in Ohio, Trump opened with tributes to MAGA supporters jailed for their role in the Jan. 6 insurrection, calling them “unbelievable patriots” and “hostages.” He called migrants entering the U.S. criminals and “animals,” who are “not people, in my opinion.” But the biggest reaction came in response to the “bloodbath” comment, which accompanied Trump’s vow to put “a 100 percent tariff” on Chinese-made electric cars. "Now, if I don’t get elected, it’s going to be a **bloodbath** for the whole—that’s going to be the least of it. It’s going to be a **bloodbath** for the country."

## AI goes to war. Artificial intelligence is reshaping military strategy and weaponry. Could autonomous killing machines be next? (ИИ вступает в войну. Искусственный интеллект меняет военную стратегию и вооружение. Машины-убийцы следующий шаг?)
Some experts worry that AI’s ability to analyze massive amounts of information - surveillance data, social media posts, even shopping habits - could result in these weapons being used to target specific ethnicities or other population groups.Drone swarms, which are being developed by China as well as the U.S., “could **wipe out,** say, all males between 12 and 60 in a city,” said Stuart Russell, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley.

## Russia: Acts of defiance against a sham election (Россия: Акты неповиновения против фиктивных выборов)
Russia held this “farce of an election” even in the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, forcing Ukrainians there to vote **at gunpoint**, said Nina Kolomiets in Podrobnosti.ua (Ukraine). In Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, poll workers accompanied by armed soldiers “went from apartment to apartment, just to get a tick on the ballot.”

# THE WASHINGTON POST . WEDNESDAY, APRIL 3 , 2024
## Zelensky signs law lowering draft age to 25 in bid to boost military ranks (Зеленский подписал указ о снижении призывного возраста до 25-и лет в попытке увеличить число военнослужащих)
Zelensky has pleaded with congressional leaders to urgently pass the White House’s requested $60 billion package for Ukraine’s war effort. On Sunday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (r-La.) said that the funding, which has been blocked for months, could be put to a vote next week after the Easter recess.  In a fox News appearance, Johnson said the bill would contain “some important innovations” — perhaps loaning the money to Ukraine. “If we can use the seized assets of russian oligarchs to allow the Ukrainians to fight them, that’s just **pure poetry**,” Johnson said.
